# The Success of Theater Campaigns

## Overview of Project
The database worked on is filled with data regarding different campaigns such as film & video, theater, journalism, music, photography etc. This data is further separated into subcategories such as television, documentaries, plays, drama, jazz etc. The database also contains information about the date created, the end date, country, and the status/outcome of the category (successful, failed, live or canceled) based on the camppaigns funding goal and actual pledged amount. Louise is interested in seeing how successful theater campaigns were based on their launch date and their funding goals. Using the data provided, I created two visuals of the theater campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to condense the large dataset into a small visual that is easy for Louis to read and see the relationship between theater campaign outcomes based on their launch date and the play subcategory campaigns based on their funding goals. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not run into any challenges while condensing this data, however the creation of the visuals was tedious work that needed my full attention to details. The need for careful review can lead to many minor misprints in formulas that will affect the solution and therefore the visual data. To properly execute the condensing of data, I needed to pay close attention to all formulas and verify they were correct multiple times before moving on to the next deliverable. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After the condensing of data based on time of year and their outcomes (successful, failed or canceled), it is evident that most theater campaigns were successful. Specifically, 839 of 1,369 (61%) were successful. 493 (36%) failed and only 37 (3%) were canceled. May, June, and July have the highest peak of successes or failures while most theater campaigns canceled were in January. Overall, it is evident that the time of year does correlate with the outcome of the campaign to a degree. However, despite the time of year, the majority of campaigns do reach their goal. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
After the condensing of data based on the different play campaigns goals and their outcomes (successful, failed or canceled) we see that most campaigns had goals between less than $1,000 and $9,999 with a the highest being between $1,000 and $4,999. The visual shows that all play campaigns were either successful or failed, there were no cancelations. Overall, the smaller the goal, the higher the success. However, there were 6 campaigns with goals between $35,000 and $39,999 and 3 campaigns with goals between $40,000 and $44,999 that each had 67% success. 

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
My first conclusion would be that the time of year effects the outcome of the campaign. Summer months May and June have a higher chance of reaching their goal. 
My second conclusion is that no matter the time of year there is a high chance that the campaign will reach its goal. However, December and January are the worst time to have a campaign because in December chances of success or failure are about 50/50 and January has the highest chance of cancelation. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I can conclude that the smaller the goal the higher the chances of success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation to the rresults of outcome based on goal is that it is based on the subcategory of plays. The outcomes based on their goal don't necessarily translate to all other subcategories of theater. 
A second limitation is that this is an overall outcome of theater and plays, the data was not filtered by country which can tell us whether certain countries have a higher chance of success. 
A third limitation is that the data is filtered by month of year, but not by actual year. Filtering by the actual year can tell us whether the popularity of theaters and plays have gone up, down or remained about the same over the years. Even though the majority of theater campaigns are hitting their goal, knowing their popularity history would help predict the future of theater campaigns and interest. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would suggest the addition of a table and graph that shows the outcome based on the overall year to see the history of theater campaigns. 
I would also suggest the addition of a graph that filters theater campaign success by countries to see if theater campaigns are more likely to succeed based on region. 
I would suugest not limiting the outcome based on goal to only plays to include all subcategories of theater. 
Finally, I would suggest a closer look at the theater campaigns with goals between $35,000 and $39,999 and between $40,000 and $44,999 because they each had a 67% success rate. These rates do not correlate with the rest of the data so it's worth looking into why and how campaigns with such high goals have high success rates.
